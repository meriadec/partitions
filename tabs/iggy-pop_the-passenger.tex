[Intro]
Am        F              C               G
Am        F              C               E
Am        F              C               G
Am        F              C               E
Am        F              C               G
Am        F              C               E

[Verse]
Am        F              C               G
I am the passenger
Am         F             C               E
And I ride and I ride
Am         F             C               G
I ride through the city back sides
Am         F             C               E
I see the stars come out of the sky
Am         F             C               G
Yeah in the bright and hollow sky
Am         F             C               E
You know it looks so good tonight

[Instrumental]
Am         F             C               G
Am         F             C               E

[Verse]
Am         F             C               G
I am the passenger
Am         F             C               E
I say under glass
Am         F             C               G
I look through my window so bright
Am         F             C               E
I see the stars come out tonight
Am         F             C               G
I see the bright and hollow sky
Am         F             C               E
Over the cities ripped back sky
Am         F             C               G
And everything looks good tonight

[Instrumental]
Am         F             C               E

(faint laas)

[Verse]
Am         F             C               G
Give in to the power
Am         F             C               E
We’ll be the passsengers
Am         F             C               G
We’ll ride through the city tonight

We’ll see the bright and hollow sky
Am         F             C               G
We’ll see the stars that shine so bright
Am         F             C               E
The stars made for us tonight

Am         F             C               E
Am         F             C               G

[Verse]
Am         F             C               E

Am         F             C               G
How how he rides
Am         F             C               E
Oh the passenger
Am         F             C               G
He rides and he rides (lisp on the s)
Am         F             C               E
He looks through his window 
(sing it faster at this bit)
Am         F             C               G
What does he see
Am         F             C               E
He sees the sight and hollow sky
Am         F             C               G
He sees the stars come out tonight
Am         F             C               E
He sees the cities ripped back sides
Am         F             C               G
He sees the winding ocean drive
Am         F             C               E
And everything was made for you and me
Am         F             C               G
All of it was made for you and me
Am         F             C               E
But it just belongs to you and me
Am         F             C               G
So lets take a ride and see what’s mine

Oh the passenger
Am         F             C               G
He rides and he rides
Am         F             C               E
He sees things from under glass
Am         F             C               G
He looks through his window side
Am         F             C               E
He sees the things he knows are his
Am         F             C               G
He sees the bright and hollow sky
Am         F             C               E
he sees the city sleep at night
Am         F             C               G
He sees the stars are out tonight
Am         F             C               E
And all of it is yours and mine
Am         F             C               G
And all of it is yours and mine
Am         F             C               E
So lets ride and ride and ride and ride____
