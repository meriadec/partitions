[Verse 1]
                                   D   G   D
Darling you've got to let me know
                                   D   G   D
Should I stay or should I go
                                   G   F   G
If you say that you are mine
                                   D   G   D
I'll be there til the end of time
                                   A
So you've gotta let me know
                                   D   G   D
Should I stay or should I go


[Verse 2]

Its always tease tease tease
You're happy when I'm on my knees
One day is fine the next is black
So if you want me off your back
Well Come on and let me know
Should I stay or should I go?


[Chorus]
                                   D   G   D
Should I stay or should I go now?
                                   D   G   D
Should I stay or should I go now?
                                   G   F   G
If I go there will be trouble
                                   D   G   D
But if I go there will be double
                                   A
So come on and let me know
                                   G   F   G
Should I stay or should I go?


[Verse 3]

This indicision's bugging me
If you don't want me to set free
Exactly whom I'm supposed to be
Don't you know which clothes even fit me
Come on and let me know
Should I cool it or should I blow?

The chorus has the same chords as the verse but is faster and the rhythm is
different. This is a pretty simple song to play, just listen to the song to pick up
the strumming pattern. Enjoy!
